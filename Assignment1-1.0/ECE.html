		<h3>ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT</h3><br>
		<p>The department is equipped with more than 23 full-fledged state-of-the-art laboratories which cater to the needs of producing highly trained and competent engineers who are already proving their quality and worth the present-day global market. The department boasts about its well-equipped Electronics and Communication Engineering Laboratories, such as Microwave Engineering, Communication Engineering, Advanced Communication Engineering, VLSI Design, Analog & Digital Electronics, Digital Signal Processing, Microwave and Simulation Laboratory. Our ECE department has received a sanctioned MODROB fund, of Rs.7 lac, from AICTE for development of Communication Laboratory  and Rs 15.74 lakh  for VLSI  design  laboratory. All of the laboratories are furnished with most up to date latest instruments and tools. The department conducts one B. Tech Programme in Electronics & Communication Engineering (NBA Accredited since 2009-2012   and  2016-2022 ) .
		Keeping precisely the above important aspects of Electronics and Communication Technology in view, we very rightly introduced in 2008 the M.Tech Course with specialization in Communication.

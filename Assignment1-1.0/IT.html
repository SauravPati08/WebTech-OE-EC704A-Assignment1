		<h3>ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT</h3><br>
		<p>Keeping precisely the above important aspects of computer science and communication technology tied together in the curriculum, the department of Information Technology was introduced in 1999, at the same time of the inception of MCKVIE. Enriched with highly qualified Faculty members and equipped with state-of-the-art computer labs the Department has been producing highly trained and competent software engineers who have already proved their quality and worth in the job market, education and even in research work.
		Information Technology as a field of study has been playing a very important part of our lives today. While one might think of the typical IT worker employed in a major software company as a software developer, the reality is that, a significant number of IT workers are found in banks, insurance companies, manufacturing plants or in some other non-IT related business. Thus human resource training and requirement in IT is still high and this stream attracts some of the most talented students who take interest in the field of Engineering and Technology.
